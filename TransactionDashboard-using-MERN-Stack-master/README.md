# TransactionDashboard

## Project Overview

**TransactionDashboard** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This application allows users to view, manage, and visualize transactions through an interactive dashboard. It features a modern, responsive design with a material color scheme, and includes a transactions table, statistics overview, and bar chart visualization for efficient tracking and analysis.

## Features

- **Transactions Table**: Displays a list of transactions for the selected month with search functionality based on title, description, and price.
- **Statistics Overview**: Shows the total sales amount, number of sold items, and number of not sold items for the selected month.
- **Bar Chart Visualization**: Visualizes the number of items within specified price ranges for the selected month.
- **Month Filter**: Dropdown for selecting a month, with the default selection set to March.
- **Search Functionality**: A search box to filter transactions by title, description, or price.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through transactions with "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
